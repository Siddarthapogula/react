## !!! Yeah parcel is such a "BEAST" right.!!!


## Yup!! Episode 3

- learnt about component. Types of components. 
- Class based component - which we do not use usually in nowadays so, we use function base components. which are quite easier to implement.
- learnt component composition. ususlly which is hair picking topic for most of the react developers

- learnt about what are elements in react how to create and to use. 

- yeah that is all!

- and one more thing learnt how to add script in configuration which is json file(A file which keep the tract of development).

# babel!!!

- Babel is Unsung Hero !!

- this is the thing which transpiles the jsx into our react.create element => object => domElements

- the flow is when we create a react element right, by using of Babel parcel transpiles the JSX in to the reactcreate element 

- at the end of the day react.createelement is and object right . and next further steps will be handled by reconciliation

- JSX is neither html nor a html in react/javascript, it is html "like" code that is it
